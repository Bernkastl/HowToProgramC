/*
 * 6.19 (Dice Rolling) Write a program that simulates rolling two dice. The program
 * should use rand twice to roll the first and second die, respectively, then calculate their
 * sum. Because each die can have an integer value from 1 to 6, the sum of the values will
 * vary from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most frequent sum and 2 and 12 the least frequent
 * sums. The following diagram shows the 36 possible combinations of the two dice:
 * https://imgur.com/jlDGhD8
 * Your program should roll the two dice 36,000 times. Use a one-dimensional array to
 * tally the numbers of times each possible sum appears. Print the results in tabular format.
 * Also, determine whether the totals are reasonableâ€”for example, there are six
 * ways to roll a 7, so approximately one-sixth of all the rolls should be 7.
