/*
 * 3.47 (Enforcing Privacy with Cryptography) The explosive growth of Internet communications
 * and data storage on Internet-connected computers has greatly increased
 * privacy concerns. The field of cryptography is concerned with coding data to make it
 * difficult (and hopefully—with the most advanced schemes—impossible) for unauthorized
 * users to read. In this exercise, you’ll investigate a simple scheme for encrypting
 * and decrypting data. A company that wants to send data over the Internet has
 * asked you to write a program that will encrypt it so that it may be transmitted more
 * securely. All the data is transmitted as four-digit integers. Your application should
 * read a four-digit integer entered by the user and encrypt it as follows: Replace each
 * digit with the result of adding 7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing
 * the new value by 10. Then swap the first digit with the third, and swap the second
 * digit with the fourth. Then print the encrypted integer. Write a separate application
 * that inputs an encrypted four-digit integer and decrypts it (by reversing the encryption
 * scheme) to form the original number. [Optional reading project: In industrial-strength
 * applications, you’ll want to use much stronger encryption techniques than presented
 * in this exercise. Research “public-key cryptography” in general and the PGP (Pretty
 * Good Privacy) specific public-key scheme. You may also want to investigate the RSA
 * scheme, which is widely used in industrial-strength applications.]
